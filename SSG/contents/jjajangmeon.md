sauce instructions:
Stir-fry the pork belly in a large, deep wok with 1 Tablespoon of vegetable oil for 
about 4-5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Pour out the excess pork fat.
Add radish and stir fry for 1 minute.
Add potato, onion, and zucchini and keep stirring for about 3 minutes until 
the potato looks a little translucent.
Clear a space in the center of the wok by pushing the ingredients to the edges.
Add 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil to the center of the wok, then add ¼ cup of black 
bean paste and stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute to fry it. 
Then mix everything in the wok and keep stirring.
Add 2 cups of water to the wok and let it cook with the lid closed for about 10 minutes
Open the lid and taste a sample of the radish and potato. If they’re fully cooked, 
stir in the starch water little by little. Keep stirring until it’s well mixed and 
thick. Add the sesame oil and remove from the heat
Serve with noodles (jjajangmyeon) or steamed rice (jjajangbap)
